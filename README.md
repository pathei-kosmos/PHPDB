# PHPDB :elephant:

Database management project in [PHP](https://www.php.net/). SQL requests use [prepare()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php) and [execute()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.execute.php) to secure the application by preventing SQL injections attacks. The front end is done in [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The application registers users, verifies that they do not already exist, displays them and allows their modification.
